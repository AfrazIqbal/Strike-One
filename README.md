## Bonus Features
**dunlfar Example,**
During the late 19th century, professional baseball was still evolving, with frequent managerial changes within teams. It wasnâ€™t uncommon for teams to shuffle managers even multiple times in a single season, especially in cases of financial instability or poor team performance.
-Added Unique Keys to ensure its physically possible to change managers even during a season.

**Edward Hanlon Example Split seasons,**
-Long ago there used to be split seasons within in a season this data does not continue to be sorted in this mannor today but I preserved it alongside the full sets for people who want to see data by split season

**Shohei's Big Bucks**
-Added in Salaries manually From Online as salaries have not been updated since 2016 Most large scale database structures were behind a paywall but there are still salaries from every year since 2016 to update the data with the top grossers.

**Automation**
Added in Custom Pythhon Script Within The Dump that with tweaking (Or as long as the CSVs retains the same descriptors - This is easily configurable with mappings) Can automatically update any database with baseball data.

```
Input For Automation
Host Name: <USER INPUT>
USER: <USERNAME>
PASSWORD: <PASSWORD>
DATABASE NAME: <DB NAME>
LOCALITY: <YES / NO>    (For optimal use store Scripts in TigerScripts and CSVs in CSV file)
```
